# Changelog

## `12.0.0` (2020-05-02)

Long-awaited fix for the "missing command" error has been implemented by hiding
whatever command it was supposed to even be (2 yearsâ€¦) for now.

Telemetry has been removed, because I haven't used it once and plan on replacing
telemetry in all my extensions by a local crash reporter which when detecting a
crash asks you to email me the report, so it becomes opt-in. I didn't feel good
about the telemetry when I introduced it and feel even worse about the prospect
of it, now, so this solution will be much more aligned with my principles.

Also, the CI has been switched over to GitHub Actions instead of Travis. I don't
have any tests for this extension yet, though, so this is not really a meaningful
change, yet.

## `11.0.0` (2018-09-21)

Implement telemetry for collecting error events.

**The telemetry reporter respects the VS Code telemetry opt-out flag.**

If you have concerns, reach out to me and I will walk you through what is collected and why.

Currently, I collect the Git invocation for `blame` errors.
This is used to determine the age of the line and thus the to-do item.

I am looking to replace this with the VS Code Git extension API directly if possible, stay tunes.

## `10.0.0` (2018-09-17)

Contribute a setting for turning the CodeLens on and off.
The setting applies automatically without the need for extension restart.

### Thank You

- John N. Underwood for suggesting a settings toggle for CodeLens

## `9.0.0` (2018-05-21)

- Display the to-do checkbox age in the CodeLens next to the date
- Hide the `done` portion of the tree view item label with counts if it is zero
- Reveal to-do item checkboxes in the center of the editor after clicking
  - The default caused issue with releaving outside of visible range
  - The at-top option caused CodeLens for that item to be hidden
- Contribute a detick command for removing just the checkbox leaving the text

## `8.0.0` (2018-05-20)

Contribute a custom view container with the MarkDown To-Do tree view.

## `7.0.1` (2018-05-20)

Create an icon for the extension when shown in the VS Code Marketplace.

## `7.0.0` (2018-05-19)

- Contribute a refresh command to the MarkDown To-Do tree view title context (reflects even unsaved changes)
- Contribute a toggle ticked command to the MarkDown To-Do tree view title context (whether to show ticked or not)
- Implement code lens for MarkDow checkboxes with contextual tick/untick command, remove command and date and time of line commit
- Display contextual tick/untick command only, not both, in the MarkDown To-Do tree view to-do item context
- Contribute a toggle sort order command to the MarkDown To-Do tree view title context:
  - Sort by file name and header order in document
  - Sort by unticked to-do item count

## `6.0.1` (2018-05-09)

- Split the toggle command into two *Tick* and *Untick* commands
- Display graphical icons to the right of the to-do items in the tree instead of in the context menu
- Introduce also an icon for the *Remove* command and show that command in the tree as well

## `6.0.0` (2018-05-08)

- Use `fileSystemWatcher` instead of `findFiles` as the latter has been unreliable
- Remove the *Open file* and *Focus header* commands as they interfered with the folding/unfolding behavior of the tree item ([a known VS Code issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34130))
- Remove the *Refresh file* command as it should not be needed anymore (the file system watcher should be reliable)
- Display checked, unchecked and total counts separately
- Save files after toggling or removing to-do items

## `5.0.5` (2018-04-26)

Exclude `files.exclude` specifically.

## `5.0.4` (2018-04-25)

Hide entries with no to-do items.

## `5.0.3` (2018-04-23)

Exclude default exclusions when looking for workspace MarkDown files.

## `5.0.2` (2018-04-23)

Upgrade MarkDownDOM for unordered list item indent calculation and do toggling replace precisely at the check character range.

## `5.0.1` (2018-04-23)

Fix parsing MarkDown headers to group items under by upgrading MarkDownDOM.

## `5.0.0` (2018-04-23)

Group to-do items underneath MarkDown headers in the tree view

## `4.0.0` (2018-04-22)

- Filter to only files that have to-do items
- Fix a bug where nested list items we're inspected to to-do items
- Display the number of to-do items in the file tree view item
- Fix a bug where nested to-do items would have their indent reset upon toggling
- Scroll to the to-do in the editor upon selecting, toggling or removing

## `3.0.0` (2018-04-22)

Convert to a version which uses a tree view to collect the to-do items.

## `2.0.0` (2018-04-22)

- Use [MarkDownDOM](https://gitlab.com/TomasHubelbauer/markdown-dom) to parse the unordered checkbox list blocks
- Use `lineCount` and `lineAt` instead of my own regex to be 100 % compatible with VS Code behavior

## `1.0.0` (2018-04-11)

- Initial release
